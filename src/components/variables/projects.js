    the next train is coming or delayed, but sometimes the train
    countdown sign is nowhere in sight or broken. With MTALens, all
    you have to do is point and shoot to see the next upcoming trains
    as well as being able to alert or view if trains are crowded
    through our platform. The app uses OCR from google vision and
    feeds it into realtime firebase and the MTA API feed for up to the
    date alerts. Don't be late again!`,

I cannot do quick maths when decimals are involved. Using react native, expo, node.js, and plain javascript-- now I don't have to do quick maths! By placing in a weight in lbs, the app will tell you how many plates you need with a helpful graphic for visualization!`,
