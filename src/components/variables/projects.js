    however sometimes people are not who they say they are. SuperLike
    is a fun e-commerce website for fake profiles used on dating apps.
    We most definitely do not encourage catfishing, but it was a lot
    of fun using pictures from our cohort as well as some of our
    instructors! It features user carts, guest checkout, products,
    user authenication, and more!`,

    the next train is coming or delayed, but sometimes the train
    countdown sign is nowhere in sight or broken. With MTALens, all
    you have to do is point and shoot to see the next upcoming trains
    as well as being able to alert or view if trains are crowded
    through our platform. The app uses OCR from google vision and
    feeds it into realtime firebase and the MTA API feed for up to the
    date alerts. Don't be late again!`,

I cannot do quick maths when decimals are involved. Using react native, expo, node.js, and plain on javascript-- now I don't have to do quick maths! By placing in a weight in lbs, the app will tell you how many plates you need with a helpful graphic for visualization!`,
