## General Info

A resume is is a quick run down of a person's past experiences and abilities, but having an online portfolio can show someone a lot more. Being able to show design, personality, and little quirks that otherwise could not be presented in a stiff resume layout. Having to build something and seeing it improve and change is one of the most satisfying feelings for me in my journey as a software engineer. You should have seen what it looked like on the first day haha. It was a fun project to quickly apply what I learned in Fullstack's Software Engineering Program.

Everybody is unique and has their own little story, with this personal website-- here's a little taste of mine!

## Technologies

* Visual Code version 1.39

## Features
